WASI and componentize-py
========================

`Componentize-py <https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py>`_ is a tool to convert Python code to a `WebAssembly Component <https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model>`_.
Urllib3 will not work out of the box with componentize-py due to missing support for the ssl module in the WASI build of CPython.

Starting from version 2.5.0 urllib3 supports being used in such an environment using a new, experimental WASI backend.

Getting started
---------------

Using urllib3 in WASI works by utilizing `wasi-http <https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http>`_ host functions. To begin,
add imports for these to the world your component is going to implement:
 .. code-block:: wit
  package unused:unused;

  world demo-world {
    import wasi:http/types@0.2.0;
    import wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0;

    export wasi:cli/run@0.2.0;
  }

To enable the WASI backend of urllib, import the contrib module and call ``enable_wasi_backend``. The parameter passed to this function
is the snake-cased version for the world name you are implementing.
This function should be called as early as possible in the lifecycle of your program, we recommend calling it directly in your entrypoint.

 .. code-block:: python
    from demo_world import exports
    from urllib3.contrib.wasi import enable_wasi_backend
    enable_wasi_backend("demo_world")
    import urllib3

    class Run(exports.Run):
      resp = urllib3.request("GET", "https://httpbin.org/anything")
      print(resp.status)  # 200
      print(resp.headers) # HTTPHeaderDict(...)
      print(resp.json())  # {"headers": {"Accept": "*/*", ...}, ...}

Features
--------

Because a number of aspects that are normally handled by the library are delegated to the host when using the WASI backend, some
features are not supported or settings are ignored. Notable cases are:

* HTTPS: Sending https requests is supported, but the entire TLS layer is handled by the host and is not customizable from the urllib3 side. Most of the parameters
specific to https requests, including custom certificate authorities are ignored.
* Tunneling:
